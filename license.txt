        2) Derivative Works refer to the works or software that could be created by the licensee, based upon the Original Work or modifications thereof, including all relevant system documentation.

        4) The Source Code refers to the human-readable form of the Work which is the most convenient for people to study and modify;

    32.5   The licensor may provide the Work either in its Source Code form, or as Executable Code.

    32.6   Nothing in this license is intended to deprive the licensee of the benefits from any exception or limitation to the exclusive rights of the rights owners in the Original Work or Software, of the exhaustion of those rights or of other applicable limitations thereto.

        3) The Licensee shall keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the license and to the disclaimer of warranties. The licensee must include a copy of such notices and a copy of the licence with every copy of the Work he/she distributes and/or communicates.

However, the licensor will be liable under statutory product liability laws as far such laws apply to the Work.
    32.12 Furthermore, the licensor shall in no event be liable for any commercial or other damages arising from the licensee’s lack of use and/or lack of right to use additional software (e.g. database server, application server) which is necessary for making of the Original Work a workable system.
    32.13   The license and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any breach by the licensee of the terms of the license.
    32.14 Without prejudice to the possibility to complete additional agreements, the licence represents the complete Agreement between the Parties as to the Work licensed hereunder. This license may be extended upon the written consent of both Parties.
    32.15 If any provision of the license is invalid or unenforceable under the applicable law, this will not affect the validity or enforceability of the License as a whole. Such provision will be construed and/or reformed so as necessary to make it valid and enforceable.
    32.16 This Licence shall be governed by the law of Spain.
